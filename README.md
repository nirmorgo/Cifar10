# Cifar10
A modular deep learning system for data handling and classification

the main components:
  * Data hanndler - load the data, split it to train\validation, and create random batches for the classifier to train on
  * Classifier - initialize the tensorflow graph, uses modular components for net architechture, cost function and solver. 

The system can easily be converted for other applications (more interesting than Cifar10)
